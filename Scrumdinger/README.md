# Scrumdinger
Scrum meetings are the daily meetings that software developers or engineers use to plan and structure their work for the day. These are typically short meetings in duration, where each attendee discusses what work they have done in the past as well as current work, and additionally, any obstacles that they may encounter that will potentially impact them in the present or the future.

This Scrumdinger app addresses the needs of a typical mobile development team. Users can create scrum meetings with desired attendees for a specific time duration. Each user has an equal amount of time to speak, or they can be skipped entirely.

## Purpose
Developed to showcase iOS knowledge learned from being a Sky Work Experience Intern at the NOW Mobile Development Team.

The original tutorial can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/getting-started-with-scrumdinger).

## Features
- Users can create scrum meetings with the required members as well as choose a meeting theme that helps differentiate and make meetings unique.
- All and any created scrums by the user are displayed on the home page that is colored by the theme of the scrum.
- Users are able to speak in scrum meetings when it is their turn and this will automatically be transcribed. There is also an audio indication when an attendee uses all their time.
- Speakers within the meeting can be skipped entirely.
- Users can edit existing scrum meeting details, such as the attendees, theme, and meeting name.
- After meetings are completed, meeting history is displayed that contains what each speaker said, i.e. the transcript as well as all the attendees.
- Within meetings, users are able to see visually how much time there is in the meeting in total, how much has elapsed, and the amount of time each speaker has with a graphical indication.
